# Restaurant webite for learning and improving skills

## The Website is HTML, CSS and Javascript based, PHP is used for communication with the server

This project is an example for a restaurant website and doesn't display a real restaurant. It is my first big project, which is mainly programmed on my 1 year internship. I didn't have any instructions for the projects and no design or functions where predetermined. The following parts are implemented in the website:

- A website with multible subpages
- Grid and Flex Elements
- A carousel slider
- Phone view
- Responsive Layout
- accordion carrier cards

## Reservation instructions

- Will be implemented, when the reservation page is finished.

## Not finished?

- Reservation page is only able to display Date and number of Persons, but not the communication with the server.
- More professional design (The design is focused on building programming constucts and not design).
